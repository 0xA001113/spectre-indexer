# Simply Kaspa Indexer
A high performance Kaspa PostgreSQL indexer implemented in Rust.  

## About
The indexer has been implemented from scratch by deriving the functional spec of [kaspa-db-filler](https://github.com/lAmeR1/kaspa-db-filler).  
As part of this process the database schema was reworked to better support concurrency.  
This means that databases populated by the lAmeR1/kaspa-db-filler must be migrated to be compatible.  
A schema migration script has been developed and is available [here](https://github.com/supertypo/kaspa-db-filler-migration).  
A compatible version of the kaspa-rest-server is available [here](https://github.com/kaspa-ng/kaspa-rest-server).

## Important notes

### Optional tables
To maximize the performance for your specific needs you should take care to disable any optional tables you don't need through command line flags.  
Currently --skip_resolving_addresses and --skip_block_relations are supported, more will be added in the future.

### Optional fields
In addition to optional tables, many fields can be left empty if they are not required for your use case.  
Use include_fields or exclude_fields arguments to fine tune. See --help for a list of optional fields.  
**Be aware that the required fields can change at any time, so take special care when upgrading the indexer!**

### Postgres tuning
Make sure to tune Postgres to your specific hardware, here is an example for a server with 12GB RAM and SSD storage:
```
shared_buffers = 2GB
work_mem = 128MB
effective_io_concurrency = 32
checkpoint_timeout = 5min
max_wal_size = 4GB
min_wal_size = 80MB
effective_cache_size = 8GB
```
In addition, I highly recommend running Postgres on ZFS with compression=lz4 for space savings as well as for improving performance. Make sure to also set recordsize=8k.

### Tn11 (10bps) note
The indexer is able to keep up with the 10bps testnet (TN11) under full load (2000+tps) as long as Postgres is running on a sufficiently high-end NVMe.  
You can consider disabling optional tables and fields to bring the requirements down if running on lesser hardware.

### Historical data
The indexer will begin collecting data from the point in time when it's started.  
If you have an archival node, you can specify the start-block using the --ignore_checkpoint argument and specify an older start block.  
Please make contact with us on the [Kaspa Discord](https://kaspa.org) if you need a pg_dump-file of historical records.

Usage: simply-kaspa-indexer [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -s, --rpc-url <RPC_URL>
          The url to a kaspad instance, e.g 'ws://localhost:17110'. Leave empty to use the Kaspa PNN
  -n, --network <NETWORK>
          The network type and suffix, e.g. 'testnet-11' [default: mainnet]
  -d, --database-url <DATABASE_URL>
          PostgreSQL url [default: postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres]
  -l, --log-level <LOG_LEVEL>
          error, warn, info, debug, trace, off [default: info]
      --log-no-color
          Disable colored output
  -b, --batch-scale <BATCH_SCALE>
          Batch size factor [0.1-10]. Adjusts internal queues and database batch sizes [default: 1.0]
  -t, --cache-ttl <CACHE_TTL>
          Cache ttl (secs). Adjusts tx/block caches for in-memory de-duplication [default: 60]
  -i, --ignore-checkpoint <IGNORE_CHECKPOINT>
          Ignore checkpoint and start from a specified block, 'p' for pruning point or 'v' for virtual
      --vcp-before-synced
          Start VCP as soon as the filler has passed the previous run. Use with care
      --skip-resolving-addresses
          Reduces database load by not tracking an address's transactions in a separate table
      --skip-block-relations
          Reduces database load by not tracking block relations in a separate table
  -u, --upgrade-db
          Auto-upgrades older db schemas. Use with care
  -c, --initialize-db
          (Re-)initializes the database schema. Use with care
      --exclude-fields <EXCLUDE_FIELDS>
          Exclude specific (non-required) fields.
                  If include_fields is specified this argument is ignored.

                  Be aware that the required fields can change, so take care when upgrading and specify every field you need.
